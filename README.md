Finding Candidate Pairs Between COVID-19 Genomes Using LSH
the many mutations of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Our job will be analysing the DNA sequences coming from the its RNA . When we are infected, the virus attacks several cells, after 2/3 cell cycles the DNA sequence will be different from person to person. Passing though different people, after hundreds of infections the cycle changes considerably and mutations are born.
Therefore, similar DNA sequences are more likely to be contracted nearby while very different sequences are more likely to come from distant geographical areas. Our work is focussed on finding similarity between the genomes of various COVID-19 strains, specifically we use localtive sensitive hashing to identify the ’candidate pairs’ of similar covid-19 genomes, and we expect them to have the same origin. We also aim to demonstrate the efficiency of LSH from the point of view of tine complexity and to demonstrate how it works better than classic deterministic algorithms.
